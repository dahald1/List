# List

## What does the project do?

*This project uses C++ to write to a .csv file which is read as a vector and using that vector it prints out the data of the csv file into the ternimal.
*You can not only read and write you can also delete a single item from the list.
*Also the program gives you an option to show the thing from the list as completed and not completed.

## The purpose of this project?
*I have a lot of TV shows, movies, and anime that I watch so I created this project as my watchlist but if changed it can be used for anything list-related.
